                    Provide the customer with a customized experience on the second most important page
                    in an e-commerce site, which is the homepage after login. This homepage should have
                    all the tools required for a business when ordering business supplies, such as order
                    tracking tools and a list of frequently ordered items. These tools should help the
                    customer purchase their business supplies quicker and easier.

                    This project adhered to agile values while following the Scrum framework. 
                    And the team structure was a perfect candidate for a two concurrent sprint model, 
                    where the design team works in the design sprint, and the development team works 
                    in the development sprint.

                        The design sprint followed a framework with design workshops scheduled throughout
                        the week, similar to Google's design sprint by Jake Knapp. And during the design
                        sprint, we went through several iterations of wireframing trying to explore every
                        possible solution that can satisfy a specific user story.

                        Using my experience in working on Web applications, I quickly realized that a
                        single page application framework would be needed to keep the codebase clean and
                        scalable. But, choosing a SPA cannot happen in isolation, so I contacted various
                        stakeholders such as the Creative Team, the Application Development Team, and the
                        eCommerce Team to gather relevant data to make a decision. In the end, I choose
                        the React framework since it was the best fit for the business.

                        During the project, I accomplished something that I am proud of; I build the
                        library that drives the functionality to drag, drop, add, delete, and resize
                        dashboard widgets. The original specifications for the dashboard project had
                        an out of box library chosen to drive this functionality; however, after UX did
                        usability testing on the library, it was determined that the out of box solution
                        did not satisfy the business problem. I took on the challenge of writing a library
                        within a single sprint.
